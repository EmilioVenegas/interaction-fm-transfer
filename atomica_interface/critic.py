"""ATOMICA as a frozen training-time critic for the diffusion model.

The objective (docs/experiment-plan.md, "The current direction"):

    L = L_diffusion + lambda * d( ATOMICA(pocket, x0_hat), ATOMICA(pocket, x_true) )

`x0_hat` is the denoiser's predicted clean ligand at step `t`, `x_true` is the
reference ligand, and ATOMICA never updates. This only ever asks ATOMICA to
compare two states of the *same* complex, which is the Phase 0 regime measured
at AUROC 1.000 -- never for a transferable absolute score across pockets, which
is the Phase 2 regime that failed. Using `x_true` in a loss is a label, not
leakage; leakage would be feeding it as a conditioning input at sampling time.

## What makes this differentiable

ATOMICA consumes a record of `(X, A, B, block_lengths, segment_ids)`, of which
only `X` is geometric. Block identity, block length, atom type and segment
membership all come from the molecular graph -- the amino-acid sequence of the
pocket and the PS_300 fragmentation of the ligand -- and none of them depends on
coordinates. So the whole non-differentiable half of the featurization can be
computed once, offline, and cached per complex
(`scripts/add_critic_targets.py`); at training time this module only scatters
coordinates into a tensor and runs the encoder, and autograd reaches `x0_hat`
through it.

Two coordinate details are easy to get wrong and are handled explicitly:

- `blocks_to_data` prepends a synthetic global atom per segment whose coordinate
  is the **mean of that segment's atoms**. For the ligand segment that mean
  depends on `x0_hat`, so it is recomputed here rather than cached, or the
  critic would be differentiating through a stale centroid.
- Fragmentation reorders ligand atoms into fragment blocks, so the record's
  ligand rows are a permutation of the stored `lig_coords` rows. The permutation
  is cached as `lig_atom_order` and applied here. Getting this wrong misaligns
  every atom silently, with plausible-looking values -- the same failure mode
  the preprocessing assert guards against.

`interface_data` must have been built with `trim=False`. Trimming selects blocks
by distance, which would make the block structure coordinate-dependent and
invalidate the caching this module relies on.
