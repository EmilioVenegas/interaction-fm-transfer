"""Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for the EGNN backbone.

`lora_rank` and `lora_alpha` have appeared in the configs since the arm-D runs,
but nothing ever read them -- there was no LoRA anywhere in the tree, so arm D
was full backbone fine-tuning under a misleading name
(`MODIFICATIONS.md`, docs/experiment-plan.md). This is the actual
implementation.

It exists because of a specific constraint. The ATOMICA critic
(`atomica_interface/critic.py`) is a *loss*, not a conditioning input, so the
critic arm deliberately runs with the ATOMICA adapter switched off -- the cached
`pocket_atomica_embeddings` derive from a two-segment encoding containing the
reference ligand and cannot be a sampling-time input. With the adapter gone and
the backbone frozen, nothing has gradients and the critic has nowhere to push.
LoRA gives it somewhere: a small number of trainable parameters that let the
EGNN's feature processing adapt without touching pretrained weights.

Standard formulation. For a frozen `W: in -> out`, the layer computes

    y = W x + (alpha / r) * B (A x)

with `A: in -> r` initialised from a normal distribution and `B: r -> out`
initialised to **zero**, so the adapted model is exactly the pretrained model at
step 0 and training starts from the checkpoint rather than from a perturbation
of it. Only `A` and `B` are trainable.
